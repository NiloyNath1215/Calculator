# Scientific Calculator

By definition, a scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems. It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

 Here is your standard calculator:

Now, look at how different a scientific calculator is:

Do you see all the extra buttons this calculator has?

## Uses

All of these extra buttons allow you to work with various kinds of numbers and problems such as these:
- Trigonometry problems
- Scientific numbers that have a multiplication by 10 to a certain power
- π problems
- Logarithm problems with base 10 and the natural base
- Probability problems that use the factorial function

You can now use your calculator to help you solve trigonometry problems involving sine, cosine, tangent, their inverses, and their hyperbolic functions. When working with trigonometric values, you can change the calculations between degrees, radians, and grads. Also, you now have access to a button for π and Euler's constant, e. There are also buttons that allow you to easily calculate exponents to the second, third, or any other power.

When working with scientific numbers, there is an ''Exp'' button that lets you easily and quickly input scientific numbers. Engineering problems make use of exponents, logs, and scientific numbers. Also, all of these types of problems are usually longer expressions that involve several steps to solve by hand. But with the use of a scientific calculator, you can now input the whole expression, push the equals button, and the calculator will perform all the calculations you need in the right order. Yes, the scientific calculator computes your problems following the order of operations.
